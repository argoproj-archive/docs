# Continuous Integration Pipeline for Kubernetes

This example shows you how to run a container-native, CI pipeline on Kubernetes using the Argo workflow engine. An Argo Workflow is a Kubernetes custom resource that consists of steps and every step runs as a container within a Kubernetes pod. These are the steps you'll run in the sample CI pipeline:


* Build 
* Run multiple tests in parallel

## Prerequisites
This example assumes the following:

* You have successfully [installed Argo](https://applatix.com/open-source/argo/get-started/installation).
* You have set you Kubernetes context to the correct cluster


## About the YAML Files

The CI workflow uses [ci.yaml](https://github.com/argoproj/argo/blob/master/examples/ci.yaml).


## Run Argo Sample CI Workflow

### From Argo CLI:

```
$ argo submit ./ci-output-artifact.yaml

```
Get the status of the running job:


```
$ argo get <job_name>

```

Get the logs of any step in the workflow

```
$ argo logs <step_name/podname>

```

### From Argo Web UI
You can see the workflow status in the Argo Web UI. You can also check the logs and artifacts generated by each step.

 

## Generate output artifact
Now lets create a workflow that saves the binary that you built in the CI workflow as output artifact.

* Setup minio following the instructions at ...
* Use the CI workflow example at [ci-output-artifact.yaml](https://github.com/argoproj/argo/blob/master/examples/ci-output-artifact.yaml).
* Submit this new workflow using same argo cli commands
