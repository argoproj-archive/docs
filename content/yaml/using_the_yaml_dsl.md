# Tutorials

The Argo tutorials take you through the creation of YAML templates for workflows and deployments of containerized apps running at scale in Argo. You'll learn how to run CI/CD workflows, deploy stateful and stateless applications, and also use external, non-containerized resources (fixtures) in your workflows.

The files for the tutorials are available in the Argo GitHub account under  the `.argo` directory of the [https://github.com/argoproj](https://github.com/argoproj) repo. Argo also provides a syntax-and-consistency checker to validate the YAML DSL definitions, which you can download from the Argo Web UI (**Navigation** > **Administration** > **Docs** > **Argo CLI**) or from the [Argo Install page](https://argoproj.github.io/argo-site/get-started/installation).

NOTE: Before you try out the tutorials, you must have installed Argo and integrated Argo with a [source repository](/../user_guide/configapplatixcluster/connectdockerhub-registry.md) and a [container registry](/../user_guide/configapplatixcluster/connectdockerhub-registry.md). By default, the Argo installation integrates with the [https://github.com/argoproj](https://github.com/argoproj) repo and the  [https://hub.docker.com/argoproj](https://github.com/argoproj) container registry.
